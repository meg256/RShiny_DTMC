# RShiny_DTMC
RShiny app for interactive discrete time Markov Chain model. 

Simple app allowing interaction with discrete-time Markov Chain model. 

Model is simulating a pathogen that infects multiple compartments, with some defined probability of transitioning between any given compartment for each time step. 

User can define own transition matrix, number of timesteps, and initial lumen population. 

Transition matrix rows must sum to 1.0.
